ðŸšŒ Project Overview
This project addresses the Smart India Hackathon 2025 Problem Statement SIH25013: Real-Time Public Transport Tracking for Small Cities under the Transportation & Logistics category. The solution focuses on developing an intelligent transport tracking system using GPS data, machine learning algorithms, and real-time analytics to improve public transportation efficiency in small cities.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Over 60% of commuters in small cities face delays due to lack of real-time information about public transport. This project aims to bridge this gap by providing accurate ETA predictions and real-time tracking capabilities.
